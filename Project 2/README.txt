FILENAMES:
dks.py --> Dijkstra Algorithm for Undirected graph ONLY.
dks_directed.py --> Dijkstra Algorithm for Directed graph ONLY.
prims.py --> Prims Algorithm File.
input1.txt --> Contains the sample graph given in the Project Pdf. 
input2.txt --> Custom graph which has 8 vertices and 13 edges.

Please Change the letter to 'U' for Undirected and 'D' for Directed graph in input1.txt and input2.txt

HOW TO RUN:
1. $python dks.py
2. $python dks_directed.py
3. $python prims.py

If the src node is not mentioned in the input graph file, the program prompts the user to select 
one of the nodes as src node by displaying the list of nodes.

NOTE: To give different input file, please change it in the algorithm file.
